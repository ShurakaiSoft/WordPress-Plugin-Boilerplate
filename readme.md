# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

## Motivation

WordPress plugins have a reasonably standardized directory/file structure along
with some common code. This project aims to kickstart the development of a new
WordPress plugin. The layout fits my own style of coding which tries to follow
best practices. It's a work in progress...

### Organisation

*	The `plugin-name` directory contains the boilerplate code. This should be
installed in the plugins directory of WordPress. 
*	Other files in the root directory are for information and administration of
this WordPress Plugin Boilerplate.

### Usage

1.	Download a zipped version of this repo.
2.	Copy the `plugin-name` directory to your `/wordpress/includes/plugins`
directory in your development environment.
3.	Rename the directory `plugin-name` to  the name of your plugin.
4.	Remane `plugin-name.php` the the same name as your plugin.
5.	Find all the TODO strings and start coding.
